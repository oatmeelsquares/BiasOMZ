# BiasOMZ
Project materials for DS 6015: DS Capstone as part of UVA School of Data Science Master's in Data Science. The goal of this project is to evaluate a model from Intel's [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/tree/master) for potential bias against protected characteristic(s).

# Potential datasets:
Audio:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammedabdeldayem/the-fake-or-real-dataset |  195k recordings but some are from AI
- https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4gzzc9k49n/4 |  7637 audio files totalling more than 9.5 recording hours (presumed all female voices)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/patient-health-detection-using-vocal-audio | speech from people with and without vocal diseases

Images:
- https://scikit-image.org/ | A Python package with image library 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image | 26,990 image datasets including 274 NLP datasets 
- https://research.google/blog/introducing-the-open-images-dataset/?m=1 | Links to popular image libraries like [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/) and  [YFCC100M](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=i&did=67&guccounter=1)

# Final deliverable:
A written report with:
- literature review including what techniques currently exist for detecting bias, their strengths and limitations
- Description of the data & how we found it
- Description of the model and what metric(s) and/or libraries we used to evaluate it, based on the lit review
- Results of evaluation
- Conclusion: does the model show bias or not?
- Potential: description of an established pipeline OR recommendations for evaluating future models

A presentation with:
- what we found in our lit review and why we chose the metrics we did
- Description of the model we chose and why we chose it
- Description of the process of getting the data, accessing the model, and evaluating it
- What we found - performance on bias metrics
- Conclusion: biased or not?
- Potential: description of an established pipeline OR recommendations for evaluating future models
